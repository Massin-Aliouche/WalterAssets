# Walter Assets — Redesign (Tailwind + Vite)

This is a minimal scaffolded redesign of https://walterassets.net using Vite + Tailwind.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Content for main pages was extracted from the live site and added under `src/pages/`.
- Original media (images/icons) were downloaded into `src/assets/originals` when available.

Live demo:

- GitHub Pages: https://massin-aliouche.github.io/WalterAssets/
